    <h1> About Me </h1>
<p>
    Hi my name is Taylor Gibson! I'm 21 years old and I was born and raised in Danville, VA. 
    I moved to raleigh the summer before 8th grade with my mom and two younger brothers. 
    I have a bear coat sharpei named Apollo. In my free time I like to hang out with friends, 
    go to the pool, do photography, go to car meets, or just kick back and watch a movie. 
    I'm currently a student at Wake Technical Community College. I'm getting my degree in graphic design.
    When i'm not in school I work full time as a social media manager.
